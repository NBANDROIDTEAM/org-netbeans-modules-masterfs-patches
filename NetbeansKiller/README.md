# NetbeansKiller
Simple testing app to enter Checking for external changes - Suspended state of Netbeans

Usage:

First run and stop the killer, to create some broken links. It does not work without it.

Start Netbeans and open some file from /tmp, to enable directory watch.

Run the killer, and commonly use netbeans, compile some project, etc.

Attention!!!  

Check if is your /tmp directory on ramdisk. Creating and deleting files ist not good for SSD disks...
